I think lab 1 took me a lot longer that I anticipated. Soldering was definitely a time suck and I also hadn't touched system verilog in so long. That being said, I think the first lab was a good way to revist the system verilog and practice writing a lab report. I'm hoping that lab 2 will be a much smoother sail after having done lab 1. Going into lab 2, I will make sure to start with testbenches before going to hardware. I think this would be a good way to verify that my design works and help save a lot of time debugging.
